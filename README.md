# ENTRI PROJECT ON AIR QUALITY ANALYSIS
Air quality is a critical factor affecting human health, environmental sustainability, and economic development. However, predicting air quality accurately is challenging due to the complex interplay of various environmental, meteorological, and anthropogenic factors. Therefore, developing an effective prediction model can aid in proactive management and conservation efforts.Here the project aims to predict NO2(Nitrogen Dioxide) concentration in the air.As the NO2 has significant impact on health and environment.Many countries have established air quality standards and regulations specifically for NO2 due to its harmful effects. Monitoring and predicting NO2 levels can help ensure compliance with these standards and avoid potential penalties.
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts NO2 concentrations in the air using the Air Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
